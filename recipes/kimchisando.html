<h2> Here, kimchi and mozzarella cheese come together
     for a twist on the classic grilled cheese.</h2>

<p>Mildly flavored mozzarella is an especially good choice
     in this recipe because it lets the kimchi shine, but you
      could also add 1/4 cup of grated Cheddar, Monterey Jack
       or even pepper Jack for more kick. If you have
        grilled steak, roasted vegetables or practically
         any other savory leftover in your fridge, chop
          it up and add about 1/4 cup to your sandwich
           along with the kimchi. </p>


     <h3>For this recipe you will need:</h3>

     <ul>
        <li>2 slice of bread</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of mayonaise</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup of mozzarella</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup of drained and chopped kimchi</li>
       
     </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heat a heavy skillet over medium-low.
    Thinly spread 1 side of each slice of bread with
     thetablespoon mayonnaise. Place the bread,
      mayonnaise side down, in the skillet
       and divide the mozzarella evenly over the slices.</li>
       <br>

<li>When the cheese has just melted (no individual
     shreds of cheese remain), 6 to 10 minutes, add
      the kimchi to one side. Use a spatula to top with
       the other slice of bread, cheese side down. Press
        with the spatula to meld, then let cook, covered,
         flipping as needed to prevent burning, until the
          bread is crusty-brown and the sandwich is warmed
           through, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>

</ol>
